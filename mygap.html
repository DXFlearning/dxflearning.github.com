<h1>My Gap</h1>



<h3> Need to find a way to keep my plant on the table in an open space office. With only a 5 feet long table, after I put a computer and 2 monitors on the table, there is not much room left for a plant.  </h3>

<ul>
  <li>I recently moved from a private office to an open space office. With this move, I lost the luxury of a window where I can keep my plant and a lot of space where I can lay around my stuff. I have to pile up 2 monitors, a laptop, a phone, staples, and books on a 6 feet  table.</li>
  <li>I have at least 6 co-workers who experienced the same problem as me. We even discussed where we were going to keep our plants before we moved.</li>
  <li>I plan to create a simple support thing for my plant. I think this can be done if I find right materials.</li>
  <li>I am a web designer. However, I'm intrigued by the idea that I put together some physical that will help manage my everyday life.</li>
